= Ports and Adapters architecture for the server

== Status

Accepted

== Context

When starting the project, I needed to choose how to organize the codebase.
Either a single module for the simplicity or multiple modules for the _long term maintainability_ (in all honesty, it's just for the fun of it).

== Decision

Split the server module into multiple components :

* web service
* domain
* data access


== Consequences

Create the following modules :

* `boat-manager-application`: the modules that configures the _Spring Boot application_ and integrates the domain with spring dependency injection.
* `boat-manager-domain`: the business logic and entities.
* `boat-manager-data`: the data access module (it's the only one with a real need as I initialize the project with the PostgreSQL driver but an in memory database could be more fitted for this tiny project).
* `boat-manager-web`: the RESTful web service implementation. Its also responsible for the authentication to the server.
