= Any Decision Records

ADR (Achitecture/Any Decision Record) are documents that record important design decisions made during the development of the application.

NOTE: For such a tiny project, it's completely overkill. But I want to show the way I work in a corporate environment.

You can find the ADR List below :

* xref:adr_1.adoc[ADR 1: Ports and Adapters architecture for the server]
* xref:adr_2.adoc[ADR 2: Use of Angular Material]
