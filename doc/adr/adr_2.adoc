= Use of Angular Material

== Status

Accepted

== Context

When starting the project, I needed to choose if we use a components library on top of Angular or not.

== Decision

The allow a faster development of the client, I would use Angular Material. It provides a lot of prebuilt components and a consistent look.

The pros :

* Faster development
* Consistent look
* Already tested

The cons :

* More dependencies
* Less control over the UI and UX of the client

== Consequences

The Angular Material library is added to the client module.
