= ADR 3 : Use of an in-memory storage instead of PostgreSQL

== Status

Accepted

== Context

As the scope of this project is closer to a POC than a real application, the use of a full Postgres DB may be overkill.

== Decision

To allow a faster startup time of the application and diminish the required tools, it would be easier to use and in-memory storage.

== Consequences

The following action will be done :

- rename the maven module `boat-manager-data` into `boat-manager-data-pgsql`
- create a new module `boat-manger-data-memory`
- modify the documentation
