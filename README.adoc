== About This Project

This project is a *job application challenge*. Yes, you read that right – this is me trying to prove I can code while simultaneously questioning my life choices. ☕

If you've stumbled upon this repository hoping to find the next revolutionary boat management system for your city marina... I have some bad news. This is purely an exercise in demonstrating my skills to potential employers.

== ⚠️ Contribution Policy

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Contributions will NOT be accepted or used.**

I know, I know – your brilliant ideas could make this the best boat manager the world has ever seen! But alas, this humble vessel is sailing solo. 🚢

Think of it like a cooking show: you can watch, you can appreciate the technique, but please don't try to season my dish while I'm being judged.

If you're feeling generous with your time and code, may I suggest contributing to an actual open-source project that needs your talents? The seas are vast, and there are many worthy ships out there! 🌊
